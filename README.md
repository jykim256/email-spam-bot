Included a free copy of the script for the Bee movie, it was obtained from http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/a1/bee-movie-script-transcript-seinfeld.html, and this was back when it was still not stale and dead like it is now. The Bee movie fortunately is not of my work. I put the transcript on another file to make the main script readable without having to scroll up and down so much.
